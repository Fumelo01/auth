# **ROLE BASED AUTHENTICATION PROJECT**




---
 
> ##### This is a very basic use-case/scenerio of Role-Based Authentication.
 
---
> ##### This is a work in progress. Hence, I'll continue to update it, as I intend to make it a complete flight booking application. However, I just had to drop this now. Enjoy ðŸ’•

> ##### With what we have here, you can signup as a user(alone), a staff, a manager, and an admin. These roles rank from the lowest to the highest respectively. I'd explain briefly below.
>> - ###### Every registered account is a user.
>> - ###### Every staff can perform user and staff duties, but cannot perform manager or admin duties.
>> - ###### Every Manager can perform user, staff and Manager duties, but cannot perform Admin duties.
>> - ###### Any Admin can perform any duty. Only the admin has Complete access to all routes.

      I later changed the reset password token validation time to 15mins, 
      as it took a while for me to receive my mail.
